## Beans v1.0.0
Beans is a little game written in pygame.

## How to Play
Each player has 6 plates with some beans and a bowl on the right side.
Two players play in turn.  
The player can pick beans from his own plate, and put one bean into each other plate and bowl anti-clockwise until there is no more beans in your hand.  
At the end of game, the player who has more beans wins.

There are some special rules:  
1. When the player put the last bean into his own bowl, he can get a bonus play chance.  
2. If the player put the last bean into his own empty plate, this bean will directly score. Meanwhile, take the opponent's beans in corresponding plate to the bowl of first player.  
3. If all of the six plates are empty, the opponent will keep playing until there is an valid plate.

## Controls
